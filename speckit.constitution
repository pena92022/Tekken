# Constitution for Competitive Gaming Analytics Platform

## Code Quality & Architecture Principles

### TypeScript Usage
- Maintain strict TypeScript typing throughout the application with no 'any' types except when absolutely necessary

### Next.js 14+ App Router Best Practices
- Follow Next.js 14+ App Router best practices with server and client components properly separated

### Error Handling and Loading States
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states for all async operations

### Component Design
- Use composition over inheritance for component design
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

### File Structure
- Maintain consistent file structure: features/[feature]/components, features/[feature]/hooks, features/[feature]/utils

## Performance Requirements

### Loading Times
- Initial page load must be under 2 seconds on 3G connections
- AI analysis results must stream to the user within 3 seconds of request

### Database Optimization
- Database queries must be optimized with proper indexes and caching strategies

### Enhancement Strategies
- Implement progressive enhancement - core functionality works without JavaScript
- Use React Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Lazy load AI model initialization to prevent blocking the main thread

## User Experience Consistency

### Design Considerations
- Design for split-screen usage (user has game on one screen, app on another)
- Provide real-time feedback during all AI processing operations
- Support keyboard shortcuts for power users during active gameplay
- Ensure mobile responsiveness even though primary use is desktop

### Accessibility and Feedback
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Clear error messages that guide users to resolution
- Loading states must be informative, not just spinners

## Testing Standards

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests required for all utility functions and hooks
- Integration tests for all API routes and database operations
- E2E tests for critical user flows (authentication, payment, AI analysis)
- Minimum 80% code coverage for business logic
- Test AI prompt engineering with sample data before production deployment

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- Never store user API keys in plain text
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Audit third-party dependencies regularly

## Data Integrity

### Database Management
- Implement database migrations with rollback capabilities
- Validate data at both client and server levels
- Use Zod schemas for runtime type validation
- Implement proper database indexes for query performance
- Regular automated backups of Supabase data

## Deployment & Monitoring

### Production Readiness
- Implement proper CI/CD with automated testing
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Monitor API usage and costs in real-time
- Log errors with proper context for debugging
- Implement health check endpoints
